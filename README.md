## Done:

### Electricity
- Alimentation: Powers cables.
- Cables: Transmits electricity.
- Movable Cables: Cables that can be moved in all directions, only vertically or only horizontally.
- Pressure Plate: Power supply that is activated only when a block is on it. Also works with Alphonse.
- Doors: Acts as a wall unless powered.
- Conveyor Belt: If powered, pushes player and movable blocks. Available in all directions.

### Obstacles
- Wall: Can't walk through or pull objects on the other side.
- Seethrough: Can't walk through but can pull objects on the other side.
- Floor: Can walk on it.
- Ice Tiles: If you push an object in a direction or walk in a direction, you'll keep going in that direction until you touch a wall or a tile that isn't ice.

### Interactables
- Alphonse : the joyful sexagenarian who you play as. Can move in all 4 directions and pull movables objects.
- Movables walls : walls that can be moved in all 4 directions, or only horizontaly or vertically.
- Victory Flag : A Nice flag that you have to touch in order to win the level.

## Todo:
- Laser
- piston
- movable that goes against the conveyor belts
- Tile that reverses electrical currents
- Tile that creates a delay in electrical currents.
- Merger Tile: Combines two electrical currents into one, but only works if both inputs are active.
- Toggle Tile: Changes state (on/off) each time it receives power, enabling complex timing-based puzzles.
- Magnet Tile: Attracts or repels movable metallic objects when powered.
- Water Tile: Blocks movement unless an object is pushed into it to create a bridge.
- Box creator or destructor
- Lava Tile: Destroys any movable object or Alphonse that touches it unless covered by a bridge object.
- Mirror Tile: Reflects electrical currents or laser beams in a new direction.
- Key and Lock: Alphonse must push a key onto a lock to unlock a specific door or trigger an event.
- Spring Tile: Launches Alphonse or objects several tiles in a specified direction when stepped on or activated.
- One-Way Gate: Allows movement or pushing of objects in one direction but blocks movement in the opposite direction.
- Wind Tile: Constantly pushes objects and Alphonse in a direction, similar to a conveyor belt but always active.
- Crumbling Tile: Breaks after a set number of uses, turning into an impassable obstacle.
